# Windowing

This example demonstrates how to optimize large lists using windowing for better performance.

## Description

Windowing (also known as virtual scrolling) is a technique that renders only the visible items in a large list, significantly improving performance and user experience. When dealing with thousands of items, rendering all of them at once can cause performance issues and slow down the application.

## React List Virtualization

React list virtualization is a performance optimization technique that:

- **Renders only visible items**: Only the items currently in the viewport are rendered
- **Reduces DOM nodes**: Dramatically reduces the number of DOM elements
- **Improves memory usage**: Less memory consumption for large datasets
- **Maintains scroll position**: Preserves scroll position during updates

## What You'll Learn

- How to implement windowing for large lists
- Performance optimization techniques for React lists
- When and why to use windowing
- Best practices for handling large datasets

## Key Concepts

- **Windowing**: Only rendering visible items
- **Performance Optimization**: Reducing DOM nodes and memory usage
- **Dynamic Height**: Handling items with varying heights
- **Scroll Position**: Maintaining scroll position during updates
